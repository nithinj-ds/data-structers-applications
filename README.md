📚 Data Structures Applications in C

This repository contains implementations of Data Structures and their real-world applications using the C programming language. The programs focus on stack operations and demonstrate practical use-cases like expression conversions, evaluation, palindrome checks, and binary conversion.

📂 Repository Structure stack_integer_implementation.c → Basic stack implementation (push, pop, display) infix_to_postfix.c → Convert infix expression to postfix using stack infix_to_prefix.c → Convert infix expression to prefix using stack postfix_evaluator.c → Evaluate postfix expressions integer_to_binary_stack.c → Convert integers to binary using stack palindrome_stack.c → Check if a string is palindrome using stack parentheses_checker_stack.c → Validate balanced parentheses/brackets using stack

🚀 Features Clean and modular C implementations Beginner-friendly code with comments Demonstrates stack-based applications Covers both algorithms & practical examples

⚡How to Compile & Run Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com//.git cd Compile a C program (replace .c with the file you want to run): gcc .c -o output Run the program: ./output

🖥️ Example To compile and run parentheses_checker_stack.c: gcc parentheses_checker_stack.c -o checker ./checker

📘 Learning Objectives Understand how stacks work internally Implement push/pop operations Apply stacks in: Expression conversion Expression evaluation Palindrome checking Parentheses balancing Integer-to-binary conversion

🌱 Future Additions Queue implementations and applications Linked list programs More real-world data structure applications
